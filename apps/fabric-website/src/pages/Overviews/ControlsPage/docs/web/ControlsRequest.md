First, check the [Fluent UI React issue queue](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/issues) or [projects](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/projects) to see if your component has already been requested or is being worked on. If you don't see an existing issue or project for the component you're looking for, please [file an issue in the repo](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/issues), and we'll respond if it's being built or on our radar.

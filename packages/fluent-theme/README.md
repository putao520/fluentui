# @uifabric/fluent-theme

**Fluent theme for [Fluent UI React](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui)**
([formerly Office UI Fabric React](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/blogs/ui-fabric-is-evolving-into-fluent-ui/))

This package contains Fluent coloring, theming and styling constants for use with Fluent UI React components.

Note that in `@fluentui/react` (or `office-ui-fabric-react`) version 7, components use the Fluent theme by default, so manually applying the Fluent theme is no longer necessary. However, this package still exports various constants which may be useful for manually styling components.

To import the Fluent theme or some example constants:

```js
import { FluentCustomizations, NeutralColors, MotionDurations } from '@uifabric/fluent-theme';
```
